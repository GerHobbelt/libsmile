== Libsmile

C implementation of the Smile binary format (https://github.com/FasterXML/smile-format-specification).

The library ships with a command line tool (unsmile) to decode binary files on the command line, as well as extensions for scripting languages.

=== Status

libsmile is under heavy development and is still considered experimental.

What is working:

* Single block decoding smile -> json (up to 64k by default, size can be increased)
* Shared String references (see below for caveat)
* Basic PHP, Ruby and Python support

What is missing:

* The following decoding use cases are not yet supported due to lack of test data (feel free to contribute json/smile samples, see data/ directory): long String, long Shared String reference for Keys decoding, BigInteger, long Unicode String, long Shared String reference, Binary, Raw Binary for Values decoding
* Streaming support: API has been designed to do chunk decoding, but is not yet functional (only single chunk for now between reset)
* Encoding support json -> smile


=== C library build

To build libsmile.la:

  make

To run tests:

  make check

=== Extensions build

To build extensions:

  make <ext>

To run tests:

  make check-<ext>

where ext is php, ruby or py.

== Usage

=== unsmile

  libsmile $ ./unsmile 
  usage: unsmile <file>

For example:

  libsmile $ ./unsmile data/smile/test1.smile 
  {"test key":true,"nullField":null,"foo":1,"foo2":{"a":3},"a√£b":-323,"2":[1,2,3],"\"foo\"":"foo\nbar"}

=== C Library

The API can be found under include/smile.h. A good starting point is tools/unsmile.c for a working example.
